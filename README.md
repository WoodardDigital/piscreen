My configuration of a PI4 as a Unifi camera display screen

STILL a WIP

Dependencies 
- Unifi camera system, or some camera system that is similar 
- bit of scripting knowhow or chatgpt foo ðŸ˜‰

This a out of the box Pi4 running a generic 64 Bit Pi OS. 

The 2 main parts of this are the Service file and the kiosk file. The kiosk file is left in the user's home directory for convenience.
