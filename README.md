My configuration of a PI4 as a Unifi camera display screen

STILL a WIP

Dependencies 
- Unifi camera system, or some camera system that is similar 
- bit of scripting knowhow or chatgpt foo ðŸ˜‰
- xdotool for refreshes and autologin


The 2 main parts of this are the Service file and the kiosk file. The kiosk file is left in the user's home directory for ease of configuration. 

ROADMAP

- Create an install script that will allow you to clone this locally, run installer and it will prompt you to do the needful.
